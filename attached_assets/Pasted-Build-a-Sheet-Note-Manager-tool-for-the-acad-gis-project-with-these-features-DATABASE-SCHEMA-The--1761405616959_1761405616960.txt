Build a Sheet Note Manager tool for the acad-gis project with these features:

DATABASE SCHEMA:
The following tables already exist in the acad-gis PostgreSQL database:
- projects, drawings
- standard_notes (company note library with sort_order)
- sheet_note_sets, project_sheet_notes, sheet_note_assignments, note_callouts
- note_block_type_associations

REQUIRED FEATURES:

1. PROJECT SELECTOR
   - Dropdown to select project (from projects table)
   - Shows all sheet note sets for that project
   - Button to create new sheet note set

2. SHEET NOTE SET MANAGEMENT
   - List all sets for selected project (name, discipline, note count, active status)
   - Create new set: name, description, discipline dropdown (Civil, Survey, Landscape, Demo, Utility)
   - Edit/Delete sets (with confirmation)
   - Set one set as active/default

3. STANDARD NOTES LIBRARY (LEFT PANEL)
   - Browse standard_notes table grouped by category
   - Show: display code assignment field, note_title, note_text preview
   - Sort by sort_order
   - Search/filter by category, discipline, tags
   - Button to "Add to Current Set" (creates project_sheet_note)

4. PROJECT NOTES EDITOR (CENTER PANEL)
   - For selected set, show all project_sheet_notes
   - Editable table with columns:
     * Display Code (1, A, R1, etc.) - editable, validates unique per set
     * Title (links to standard if applicable, or shows custom)
     * Text preview (first 100 chars)
     * Source (badge: "Standard" or "Custom")
     * Usage Count (how many sheets use this note)
     * Actions: Edit, Delete, Reorder
   - Drag-to-reorder (updates sort_order)
   - Create custom note button
   - Edit modal shows full text, allows modification (sets is_modified flag if from standard)

5. SHEET ASSIGNMENTS (RIGHT PANEL)
   - Select a project_note from center panel
   - Shows which drawings/layouts currently use this note
   - List format: Drawing Number | Layout Name | Legend Seq | Actions
   - Add Assignment: Select drawing + layout name, auto-assigns next legend_sequence
   - Remove assignment button
   - Bulk assign: "Add to all sheets in drawing" option

6. LEGEND PREVIEW
   - Generate read-only preview of note legend for selected drawing/layout
   - Format: Display Code | Note Text
   - Ordered by legend_sequence
   - Export as CSV/JSON

7. VALIDATION & STATS
   - Check for duplicate display codes within project (across all sets)
   - Warn if notes exist but aren't assigned to any sheets
   - Show summary: Total sets, Total notes, Total assignments, Unassigned notes

TECH STACK:
- React (functional components with hooks)
- PostgreSQL connection using existing acad-gis database config
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React DnD or similar for drag-to-reorder
- Toast notifications for success/error messages

UI LAYOUT:
Three-column layout:
[Standard Library] [Project Notes Editor] [Sheet Assignments]
     25%                   45%                    30%

Top bar: Project selector, Active Set selector, Stats badges

STYLING:
Use acad-gis theme (dark mode, neon accents similar to Mission Control aesthetic)

API ENDPOINTS TO CREATE:
GET    /api/sheet-note-sets?project_id=
POST   /api/sheet-note-sets
PUT    /api/sheet-note-sets/:set_id
DELETE /api/sheet-note-sets/:set_id

GET    /api/project-sheet-notes?set_id=
POST   /api/project-sheet-notes
PUT    /api/project-sheet-notes/:project_note_id
DELETE /api/project-sheet-notes/:project_note_id
PATCH  /api/project-sheet-notes/:project_note_id/reorder

GET    /api/sheet-note-assignments?drawing_id=&layout_name=
GET    /api/sheet-note-assignments?project_note_id=
POST   /api/sheet-note-assignments
DELETE /api/sheet-note-assignments/:assignment_id

GET    /api/standard-notes (already exists, just use it)

GET    /api/sheet-note-legend?drawing_id=&layout_name= (generates legend preview)

PRIORITY:
Focus on Set Management → Project Notes Editor → Assignments
The note callouts and block associations can be added in future iteration.

Build this as a standalone React app that can be integrated into the acad-gis tool launcher.
